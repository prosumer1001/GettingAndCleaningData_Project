# README

This document is the codebook for the `completeDF` data set created by compiling the eight different text files used by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 by Reyes-Ortiz et al. University degli Studi di Genova, Italy.

The original study used the following coding mechanism for all of their variables:

> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

> These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The difference between the original file and the naming conventions used in this data frame include the removal of all special characters (i.e. **-** and **()**).  Camel casing was maintained for clarity, so analysts should be forewarned to ensure they do not mis a capital letter when writing code.  A prior exmaple might be:  `fBodyAcc-mean()-X` and the new variable name is `fBodyAccmeanX`.  The  upper case letters should make visual decoding of each variable more easy, and aware analysits can shoose to send all to lower case if desired, see the following code-chuck to lower all of the names in the dataset.

```{r TOLOWER, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
tolower(names(completeDF))
```

The practical benefits of maintaining the original coding rubric is that a major transformation has not taken place, so using the original code-book ensures replicability with less errors, which should increase the likelyhood of replication, all else equal.  Maintaining the original upper case letters and providing code to lower them also allows analysts to tailor the names to the preference.

Four new variables were added to the `codebookDF` that were not originally captured data:

* `subjectId` provides the test subject's unique identifier, number 1-30
* `factor` provides the a number 1-6 for the six levels of effort exerted, correlates to the label variable
* `label` provide the character vector for the exercise conducted during testing/training

1. Walking
2. Walking upstairs
3. Walking downstairs
4. Sitting
5. Standing
6. Laying

* `ID` is a unique number that provides an object ID uniquely tied to each observation.

The names of the variables come from the features text file and they map onto the x_test and x_train text files.

The R version used for this data transformation is:
